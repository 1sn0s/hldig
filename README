[Wikipedia states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ht-//Dig)
"The last official release is Dig 3.2.0b6 announced on 16 June 2004"

On Nov 3th, I found an htdig repo on GitHub that appeared to be last updated
Jun 19, 2004.

However, I noticed a [release](https://github.com/andy5995/htdig/releases)
versioned 4.1.0 was published (unofficially) on May 17, 2007.

After reading through some of the documentation, I concluded that the original
developers of htdig had continued some work on it after the last official
release of 3.2.0b6 in 2004.

I had become interested in htdig recently because of a project I'm working
on. I decided to mirror the abandoned htdig repo I found and perhaps
work on it a little from time-to-time, and see if any developers more
experienced than I would be interested in working on it as well.

I made a couple branches at key points before I made any new commits.

I haven't altered the documentation below.

*** ht://Dig 4.0 interim README information ***

We are in the process of upgrading ht://Dig to use a different backend
database than what is currently used. This will cause enough changes to
warrant a version change up to 4.0. Along with redesigning the backend
database, htsearch is being looked at to possibly be broken into two
separate modules, htsearch and htdisplay (display to be finished some
time afterwards).
